            <p>These images consists of both my inital and final moodboards ! The first moodboard displayed this retro 8bit theme while also keeping aesthetic colours such as pink, purple, blue.</p>
            <p2>That said, my inital prototype didn't have that unison in aesthetic and so I researched a new style. That brings me to the image furthest to the left, these images are from Windows 95 and displayed an accurate representation of a desktop which is exactly the vibe and feeling I was going for !</p2>

        <div class="initial-text">
            <p>As mentioned before, this prototype's design is a bit all over the place. There is no set theme and you can tell from the colour of the components that I had no intent of mimicking a realistic desktop. Other features like my static glitch image were not clear at first glance due to the random colours that do not correlate with the rest of the design. The emphasis on my game being a system/desktop is not clear overall, leaving my users confused about the setting.</p>

            <p>The process was a bit long but eventful ! From relearning Unity, familiarizing myself with C# again, and user testing, I was able to create a smooth flow of my game. With a bit of research after user testing, I dove into the aesthetics of the old Windows UI and was fascinated by Windows 95. That said, the theme of Windows 95 gave such unison and realism to my game. With long nights of getting my scripts to coordinate with one another, I successfully created 5 separate tasks and fully functioning dialogue scenes !</p>
